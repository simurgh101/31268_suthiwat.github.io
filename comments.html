                    The technical structure of my website uses a variety of HTML tags to create a clear and accessible design. Here's a breakdown of the key tags used and their roles:
                    </p>
                    
                    <!-- List of HTML Tags -->
                    <ul>
                        <!-- div tag -->
                        <li><strong>div:</strong> The <code>div</code> tag is used to create sections or divisions within the webpage. It helps organize content into logical groups and is often used for layout and styling purposes. I used it to create sections for the header, footer, navigation, and various content areas.</li>
                    
                        <!-- li tag -->
                        <li><strong>li:</strong> The <code>li</code> tag defines a list item. I used this tag to create unordered lists, providing clear itemization and easy-to-read bullet points in the "Structure" and "Aesthetic Considerations" sections.</li>
                    
                        <!-- table tag -->
                        <li><strong>table:</strong> The <code>table</code> tag defines a table structure. I used this tag to present tabular data in a clear and organized manner. It's a useful element for displaying information in rows and columns.</li>
                    
                        <!-- body tag -->
                        <li><strong>body:</strong> The <code>body</code> tag contains all the visible content of the webpage. It serves as the primary container for all other HTML elements. Everything you see on the webpage is within this tag, ensuring the page structure is maintained.</li>
                    
                        <!-- h1, h2 tags -->
                        <li><strong>h1, h2:</strong> These tags define headings. The <code>h1</code> tag is used for the main heading of a page, while the <code>h2</code> tag represents subheadings. Proper use of these tags creates a clear hierarchy and improves accessibility for screen readers.</li>
                    
                        <!-- p tag -->
                        <li><strong>p:</strong> The <code>p</code> tag defines a paragraph. It separates blocks of text into distinct sections, enhancing readability and allowing for appropriate spacing. I used this tag to create well-structured and readable content throughout the website.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>
                    Together, these HTML tags form the foundation of my website's technical structure. By organizing content with <code>div</code> and <code>body</code>, using <code>h1</code> and <code>h2</code> for headings, and incorporating lists with <code>li</code>, the site achieves a clean and accessible design. The addition of <code>table</code> for tabular data and <code>p</code> for paragraph spacing further enhances the readability and functionality of the website. 
    
                <!-- Aesthetic Considerations Section -->
                <h2 id="aesthetic">Aesthetic Considerations</h2>
                <p>
                    The aesthetics of my website play a crucial role in creating a visually appealing and user-friendly experience. I considered several key factors, such as font spacing, color contrast, and layout design, to achieve a clean and inviting look. Here's an overview of the elements that contribute to the website's aesthetics.
                    </p>
                    
                    <!-- Font Spacing -->
                    <h3>Font Spacing</h3>
                    <p>
                    I ensured proper font spacing to enhance readability and avoid a cluttered appearance. Using CSS properties like <code>line-height</code> and <code>letter-spacing</code>, I balanced text density and white space. Adequate line height allows for easy reading, while letter spacing adds clarity, especially for larger text blocks. This careful attention to font spacing creates a visually appealing layout that guides the reader through the content without causing strain or confusion.
                    </p>
                    
                    <!-- Color Contrast -->
                    <h3>Color Contrast</h3>
                    <p>
                    To maintain high readability and accessibility, I focused on achieving a strong color contrast throughout the website. By using contrasting colors for text and background, the content remains clear even for users with visual impairments or color blindness. I selected a simple color palette with bold text on a light background to ensure good visibility. This approach aligns with web accessibility guidelines, promoting inclusivity and ease of use.
                    </p>
                    
                    <!-- Layout Design -->
                    <h3>Layout Design</h3>
                    <p>
                    The layout design is clean and intuitive, with consistent elements across all pages. I used CSS to control alignment, margins, and padding, ensuring proper spacing between elements. This consistent layout approach helps users navigate the site effortlessly, with clear distinctions between different sections. The use of white space is deliberate, providing breathing room for text and enhancing the overall aesthetic appeal.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    These aesthetic considerations contribute to a website design that is visually appealing, accessible, and easy to navigate. By focusing on font spacing, color contrast, and layout design, I aimed to create a positive user experience that accommodates a wide range of visitors.
                    </p>
                <!-- Accessibility Section -->
                <h2 id="accessibility">Accessibility</h2>
                <p>
                    Accessibility is a critical aspect of web design, ensuring that all users, regardless of physical or cognitive abilities, can use and understand your website. In my website, I applied various practices to achieve this goal, utilizing both general accessibility techniques and specific features from Google.
                    </p>
                    
                    <!-- Google Accessibility Features -->
                    <h3>Google Accessibility Features</h3>
                    <p>
                    One key aspect of accessibility is compatibility with Google accessibility tools, such as Google Chrome's built-in accessibility features and Google's Lighthouse audit tool. These tools help identify and address accessibility issues. Here's how I leveraged these features:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Google Chrome Accessibility Checker:</strong> I used Chrome's accessibility audit to ensure that my website met standards for color contrast, semantic HTML structure, and keyboard navigability. This tool helped me identify areas for improvement and ensure my site was accessible to screen readers.</li>
                        <li><strong>Google Lighthouse:</strong> I ran Google Lighthouse audits to assess the website's overall accessibility. This tool provides detailed reports on accessibility factors, including text-to-background contrast, proper use of ARIA attributes, and semantic HTML elements.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    
                    <!-- Semantic HTML -->
                    <h3>Semantic HTML</h3>
                    <p>
                    Using semantic HTML such as strong and span, is essential for accessibility, as it helps screen readers and other assistive technologies interpret the content correctly. I ensured that my website used proper HTML tags, like <code>h1</code> for the main heading, <code>h2</code> for subheadings, and <code>p</code> for paragraphs. This semantic structure improves the navigation and comprehension of the website for visually impaired users.
                    </p>
                    
                    <!-- Alternative Text and Keyboard Navigation -->
                    <h3>Alternative Text and Keyboard Navigation</h3>
                    <p>
                    I included alternative text (alt text) for all images to ensure users with visual impairments can understand the content. This text describes the image's content and purpose, allowing screen readers to convey the information accurately. Additionally, I designed the website to be navigable using only the keyboard, ensuring users who cannot use a mouse can still move through the site effectively.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    These accessibility features ensure that my website is usable by a wide range of users, including those with disabilities. By focusing on compatibility with Google accessibility tools, using semantic HTML, providing alternative text for images, and ensuring keyboard navigability, I aimed to create a website that is both accessible and inclusive.
                    </p>
    
                <!-- Reflection Section -->

                <p>This project has been a valuable learning experience, allowing me to improve my HTML and CSS skills. The
                    website meets assignment requirements and demonstrates effective design. The accessibility features
                    ensure the site is usable by a wide range of users, including those with disabilities.</p>
