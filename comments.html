                    In creating my personal website, my focus was on simplicity, usability, and accessibility. I designed it to offer clear navigation and a cohesive user experience.
<br><br>
Structure: 
The site consists of four pages: a home page, a page about my past, a page about my future aspirations, and a comments page where I reflect on the design. I used simple HTML for page structure, ensuring proper use of elements like div, span, and table. I included hyperlinks for easy navigation, with consistent placement across all pages.
<br><br>
Technical Aspects:
The CSS is centralized in one file, websystems.css. It contains a combination of classes and IDs to style different elements, ensuring separation of content and design. I used five CSS classes for general styling and one ID for a unique element. To demonstrate a variety of HTML elements, I included a table on one page, an image, and a list to organize content logically.
<br><br>
Aesthetics: 
My goal was to create a clean, visually appealing layout. I used a simple color scheme to maintain readability and avoid overwhelming users. The typography is consistent across all pages, contributing to a harmonious look. The layout emphasizes content readability, with sufficient spacing and a clear hierarchy.
Accessibility
Accessibility is an essential aspect of web design. To ensure my website is accessible to visually impaired users and compatible with screen readers, I followed these guidelines:
<br><br>
Semantic HTML:
I used semantic HTML tags for clear structure, making it easier for screen readers to understand the content.
Alt Text for Images: All images include descriptive alt text, allowing users with visual impairments to understand their content.
Keyboard Navigation: Navigation links are clearly defined, enabling users to move through the website using keyboard controls.
<br><br>
Text Contrast: 
I ensured that text has sufficient contrast against the background for readability by those with visual impairments.
No Javascript Dependence: The website doesn't rely on Javascript, ensuring that users with script blockers or screen readers can still access all content.
Feel free to adjust the content and add more details about your specific experience and design choices, especially in terms of the CSS styles you used and why.
